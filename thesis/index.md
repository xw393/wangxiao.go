## Summary

I did my PhD research project on Partial Least Squares Path Modeling (PLS-PM) 
under the supervision of <a href="http://recerca.upc.edu/liam/menu1/tomas-aluja" target="_blank">Dr. Tomas Aluja</a>. 
In particular, I worked on segmentation 
issues and we proposed the **Pathmox** approach for obtaining segmentation trees 
of PLS path models.

Briefly, what we did was to develop an algorithm that produces a segmentation 
tree with a similar structure of a binary decision tree. The aim of the algorithm 
is to select, among a set of segmentation variables, those having more discriminant 
capacity to separate the path models as much as possible. The result is a Pathmox 
tree in which each node corresponds to a different segment with its own particular path model.
